# data-guardian 🔒

`data-guardian` is a nimble, zero-dependency and lightweight NPM package crafted for developers who prioritize data security and privacy. This handy utility enables you to mask sensitive strings and object properties, safeguarding critical data from prying eyes, especially in logs or UI displays. Notably, it maintains the immutability of your data by default, though this feature is optional and customizable based on your needs.

## ✨ Features

- 🔒 **String Masking**: Conceal parts of a string to hide sensitive data while keeping some characters visible for validation.
- 🕵️ **Object Masking**: Automatically masks properties identified as sensitive in objects.
- 📜 **Argument Masking**: Mask sensitive data in an array of arguments.
- 📝 **Custom Sensitive Data**: Define your own custom regular expressions to identify and mask sensitive data in strings.
- 🗺️ **Map Support**: Mask sensitive data in Map instances.
- 🔮 **Immutability (Optional)**: By default, it doesn't alter your original data structure unless configured to do so.
- 🖌️ **Custom Masking**: Define your custom logic to pinpoint which keys in objects should be masked.
- 📦 **Lightweight**: No dependencies, no bloat. `data-guardian` is a lightweight package that won't slow down your app.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Installation

```sh
npm install data-guardian
```

### Usage

Here's a quick peek at how `data-guardian` can be integrated into your JavaScript/TypeScript projects:

```javascript
const { maskData, maskString, maskArguments } = require('data-guardian');

// Masking a string
console.log(maskString('SensitiveData123!')); // Output: "Se************123!"

// Masking an arbitary string with sensitive data
console.log(maskString('a dude once exposed his super secret A1vbcvc.De#3435?r password to the world but luckily we could help')); 
// Output: "a dude once exposed his super secret A1***********35?r password to the world but luckily we could help"

// Masking object's properties
const user = { username: 'johndoe', password: 'SuperSecretPassword!' };
console.log(maskData(user)); 
// Output: { username: 'johndoe', password: 'Su***************d!' }

// Masking arguments list
console.log(maskArguments(['SensitiveArgument1', 'SensitiveArgument2'])); 
// Output: ["Se*****************1", "Se*****************2"]
```

## 📚 Defaults
By default, `data-guardian` masks the following data types in free-form strings and object properties:
* credit card numbers
* email addresses
* IPv4 addresses
* UUIDs
* phone numbers
* social security numbers
* URLs
* Passwords
* Custom sensitive data (see [Customization](#-customization))

## 🛡️ Immutability

By default, `data-guardian` preserves the immutability of your data, meaning your original input remains untouched. However, if you prefer to alter the original data, you can do so by setting the immutability option to `false`.

```javascript
const user = { password: 'SuperSecretPassword!' };
maskData(user, { immutable: false }); // This will mutate the `user` object
console.log(user); 
// Output: { password: 'Su***************d!' }
```

## ⚙️ Customization

With data-guardian, you're not limited to the predefined sensitive data types! You can extend its functionality by providing your own custom regular expressions for identifying and masking sensitive data in strings, or by providing a custom function to determine which keys to mask in objects:

```javascript
// Define a custom regex that identifies a pattern "customSensitiveData: any-text-here"
const customRegExp = { customPattern: /customSensitiveData:\s*(\S+)/gi };

const data = {
    id: 1,
    name: 'Test Name',
    customField: 'customSensitiveData: verySensitive'
};
console.log(maskData(data, { customSensitiveContentRegExp: customRegExp })); 
// Output: { id: 1, name: 'Test Name', customField: 'cu******************************ve' }

// Custom regular expressions for string masking
const customPatterns = {
    secretCode: /my-secret-code-\d{3}/gi, // matches 'my-secret-code-123', 'my-secret-code-456', etc.
};

console.log(maskString('Here is my-secret-code-123!', { customPatterns }));
// Output: "Here is my-*********-123!"

const customMaskingLogic = (key) => {
// add your custom logic here. Return true for keys you want to mask
return ['customSensitiveKey', 'anotherSensitiveKey'].includes(key);
};

const data = { customSensitiveKey: 'HideThis', anotherSensitiveKey: 'AndThis', normalKey: 'ButNotThis' };
console.log(maskData(data, { keyCheck: customMaskingLogic })); 
// Output: { customSensitiveKey: 'Hi******s', anotherSensitiveKey: 'An******s', normalKey: 'ButNotThis' }
```

## 🌟 Advanced Usage
Masking Data in a Map

`data-guardian` isn't limited to just plain objects; it can also work with Map instances! Here's how you can mask sensitive data stored in a Map:

```javascript
const sensitiveMap = new Map();
sensitiveMap.set('username', 'johndoe');
sensitiveMap.set('password', 'SuperSecretPassword!');

const maskedMap = maskData(sensitiveMap, {
  keyCheck: (key) => key === 'password', // Only mask the 'password' key
  immutable: true // Returns a new Map instance, keeping the original sensitiveMap unchanged
});

console.log(Array.from(maskedMap.entries()));
// Output: [["username", "johndoe"], ["password", "Su***************d!"]]
```

Remember, when working with Maps, the immutable option is especially handy as it prevents the original Map from being altered, ensuring data integrity and consistency across your application.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

`data-guardian` is designed to provide an additional layer of security by masking strings and object properties that contain sensitive information. However, it is not a substitute for comprehensive security practices. Ensure you follow industry standards and regulations for data protection and privacy.
